# droidwook
Find new memes

## Summary
This is a basic script for personal use. Basically, the idea is that it finds
sequences of words that can be formed by removing letters from a phrase. That
is, it finds valid English words that are subsequences of some string. This is
used often in online memes, for example with the phrase "What about the droid
attack on the Wookies?" This program can be used to generate such memes.

There is no installation, simply run the script in place. For directions, run
`./droidwook --help`. Just know that it is possible to use an arbitrary
dictionary of words and that you can specify the number of words.

There exists a faster C++ version of this program that is not currently on the
internet.
